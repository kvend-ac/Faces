# Milestone Projects 13-15 - Faces
https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/77 and https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/78

This milestone project is in 2 parts:

+ Part1 allows adding a contact from a picture in the photo library, displaying a list of contacts, and displaying details of a contact
+ Part2 adds retrieving and storing location when the contact is added, displaying location on a map

#### Note

I also added a search bar for names and descriptions, as well as the ability to fully edit an existing record, including both replacing the photo and changing the location. 
To save the data, I used a simple JSON file written out to the documents directory. The app was written using the MVVM architecture.
